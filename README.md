# Brain Functional Networks - An Interpretable Graph Classification Solution

We started from a real use case scenario: identifying the regions of the brain which are most affectedby alcohol consumption. The brain can be represented as a functional network (a weighted complete graph): nodes are regions, while edges represents regions connections. Edge weights illustrate nodes correlations (how strong two brain regions are correlated), their range values being between 0 and 1. The outcome of the project was an analysis of these networks in two different states: alcohol and non-alcohol. The analysis was obtained by building an interpretable graph classification pipeline.

In Palcu et al. [1] we used Deep Graph Convolutional Networks (DGCNN) Zhang et al. [2], that takes as input graphs of arbitrary structure and builds a graph classification model by applying end-to-end gradient based training. The graph classification model is used for distinguishing between different functional network states: Control (initial state) and Alcohol. However, one major issue is the lack of interpretability of such a model.  To overcome this issue, we integrated an adapted version of the Grad-CAM Selvaraju et al. [3] method that enables the visualization of the feature-importance map, thus highlighting the discriminative features.
